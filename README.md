# Cisco VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing Project

This project simulates a **multi-VLAN enterprise network** built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, featuring full **inter-VLAN communication**, **static routing**, **NAT**, and integrated **DNS + HTTP servers** for end-to-end connectivity and name resolution.

## Technologies Used
- VLAN configuration & trunking  
- Inter-VLAN routing (**Router-on-a-Stick**)  
- Static routing  
- NAT (Internet access simulation)  
- DNS and Web (HTTP) servers  
- Manual IP configuration on clients  

## Topology Overview

## Files
- [`Cisco-VLAN-InterVLAN-Routing-Project.pkt`](VLAN_internet.pkt) — Cisco Packet Tracer topology  
- [`README_detailed.md`](README_detailed.md) — Full technical documentation  
- `/screenshots/` — Verification results and network diagrams  

## Highlights
- Multiple VLANs with isolated traffic for better network segmentation.  
- A central router performing **Inter-VLAN routing and NAT** for Internet access.  
- **DNS and HTTP servers** simulate real enterprise services.
